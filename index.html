    <p>Wildfires are widespread, unplanned, and uncontrolled fires that burn large amounts of vegetation and ecosystems.
    </p>
    <p>This causes significant damage to natural habitats, and property and contributes to climate change by releasing large amounts of carbon emissions (especially carbon dioxide), harming human health and contaminating water supply.
    </p>
    <p>By taking certain precautions, we can protect our communities and natural resources from life-threatening wildfires.

    <h3>Where can this problem have lasting effects?</h3>
    <p>Areas with a lot of vegetation are at major risk when it comes to wildfires. It can disrupt natural habitats, deplete food resources for the animals living in those ecosystems, and have long-term effects such as reduced tree regeneration. To prevent wildfires from ruining ecosystems, there should be measures taken to manage the components that cause wildfires:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove dead vegetation. </li>
        <li>Cut vegetation low. </li>
    </ul> 
    <p>
        This can manage the fuel that causes wildfires to spread quickly.
    </p>

    <h3>What areas are the most affected by wildfires?</h3>
    <p>Urban areas surrounded by shrublands and other dry vegetation are greatly affected and are prone to the spread of wildfires, as they can damage property and vegetation that people rely on for food. To prevent the spread of wildfires in these areas:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Educate people about fire safety (making an emergency fire plan).</li>
        <li>Having underground power lines to prevent ignition.</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>
        These steps will ensure the reduction of the rate at which wildfires are created and spread.  
    </p>

    <h3>How do you prevent water contamination?</h3>
    <p>Large bodies of water, such as streams and rivers, which are located near wildfires can have lasting effects of poor water quality due to the drifted ash and pollution entering these areas. To stop the contamination of water during a wildfire:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Limit the use of plastic materials for infrastructure. </li>
        <li>Use backflow prevention to prevent contaminated water from entering pure water. </li>
    </ul> 
    <p>
        These measures minimize the negative impact of fire damage.
